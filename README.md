# DevOps Assessment

This project contains three services:

* `quotes` which serves a random quote from `quotes/resources/quotes.json`
* `newsfeed` which aggregates several RSS feeds together
* `front-end` which calls the two previous services and displays the results.

## Prerequisites

* Java
* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) (can be installed using `brew install leiningen`)

## Running tests

You can run the tests of all apps by using `make test`

## Building

First you need to ensure that the common libraries are installed: run `make libs` to install them to your local `~/.m2` repository. This will allow you to build the JARs.

To build all the JARs and generate the static tarball, run the `make clean all` command from this directory. The JARs and tarball will appear in the `build/` directory.

### Static assets

`cd` to `front-end/public` and run `./serve.py` (you need Python3 installed). This will serve the assets on port 8000.

## Running

See [Candidate Guidelines](CANDIDATE_GUIDELINES.md) on how to run the services.

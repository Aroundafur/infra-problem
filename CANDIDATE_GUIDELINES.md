## Running

All the apps take environment variables to configure them and expose the URL `/ping` which will just return a 200 response that you can use with e.g. a load balancer to check if the app is running.

### Front-end app

`java -jar front-end.jar`

*Environment variables*:

* `APP_PORT`: The port on which to run the app
* `STATIC_URL`: The URL on which to find the static assets
* `QUOTE_SERVICE_URL`: The URL on which to find the quote service
* `NEWSFEED_SERVICE_URL`: The URL on which to find the newsfeed service
* `NEWSFEED_SERVICE_TOKEN`: The authentication token that allows the app to talk to the newsfeed service. This should be treated as an application secret. The value should be: `T1&eWbYXNWG1w1^YGKDPxAWJ@^et^&kX`
